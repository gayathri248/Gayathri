To "crack the market code" with AI-driven stock price prediction using time series analysis, you need a dataset with historical stock prices, typically including:

Date

Open

High

Low

Close

Volume


Option 1: Real-time Dataset Using yfinance (Recommended)

yfinance is a Python library to download real stock data from Yahoo Finance.

Example:

import yfinance as yf

# Download data for Apple (AAPL)
df = yf.download('AAPL', start='2015-01-01', end='2023-12-31')
print(df.head())

This will give you a DataFrame like:

You can save it as a CSV for offline use:

df.to_csv('AAPL_stock_data.csv')

Option 2: Download Datasets from Kaggle

You can get public datasets from Kaggle:

Historical Stock Market Dataset

S&P 500 Historical Data


Youâ€™ll need a Kaggle account and install the Kaggle CLI:

pip install kaggle

Then download like:

kaggle datasets download -d borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs

Which is Best?

Use yfinance for always up-to-date real data with no download required.

Use Kaggle datasets if you want large volumes of data or multiple tickers in one file.
